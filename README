SuperCauldrons is an extremely simple plugin for Bukkit (an API for the Minecraft game server) created to solve two problems:

-Unlimited water sources have to be created with what really just amounts to an abuse of the engine's water physics.
-Cauldrons are basically useless, as they're just a development leftover from potion brewing before it was replaced with the Brewing Stand.

SuperCauldrons solves both these problems by making Cauldrons infinite water sources. Just pour water into the cauldron, and you have an unlimited source of water for both buckets and bottles.

Features:

-Cauldrons are infinite water sources once filled with water.
-You can fill multiple stacked empty bottles at once with water. As filled bottles don't stack, any excess bottles will be dropped on the ground.
-Water flowing over the top of a cauldron will fill the cauldron.
-Redstone power applied to a cauldron with water will eject the water out of the top. When unpowered, the water will go back into the cauldron.
